### Progress : 

Having completed the initial stage of building the cpu during lab 4, the team went over the project brief and assigned tasks to each team member.

**My tasks will be to implement the control unit.**

The current version is still a rough start and needs to be refined in the following ways going forward : 

- Maintain consistent style
- Use data bus I/O rather than individual bits (less clutter)
- Implement hardware to perform the additional instructions

### Plan : 

- Agree on a style with the team (CamelCase for modules and IO and lower_snake_case for inernal signals)

- Edit the current modules so that they adhere to the style and implement data bus IO

- Design schematics for the hardware requires to implement the additional instructions in issue
